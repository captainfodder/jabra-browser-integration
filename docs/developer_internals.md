# Developer information

This document contains various implementation details of interest to developers and advanced integrators of the browser sdk. Normal users of the Jabra client API should not need this information.

## Chromehost executable

The native chromehost executable integrates the Jabra C sdk with browser
through chrome extension. The chromehost executable is written in C++ and 
compiled using the [cmake](https://cmake.org/) build tool.

### Prerequisites 

* Windows: Visual Studio 2017 (command line tools), cmake, [Wix Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/).

* Mac: Xcode, cmake

* Ubuntu: build-essential, libasound2, [libssl v1.0.2 from ubuntu 18.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/libssl1.0.0), cmake


### Building Chromehost
To build open a command shell, CD into src/ChromeHost and enter the following commands:

+ All platforms (unless directory already exist)

```
mkdir build
```

+ Windows:
```
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A Win32
cmake --build . --target ALL_BUILD --config Release
```

+ Mac/Linux:
```
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
### Building chromehost installers

+ Windows: 
For Windows the installer build using Visual Studio with the [Wix Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/) extension. The version number must be specified in the outputname in the project file
and in Version attribute in the Product file.

+ Mac:
For MacOS the installer is build 
in 4 steps:
    1. run buildinstaller.sh (done by CI)
    2. run notarize.sh -u <username> -p <password> -f JabraChromeHostxxxx.pkg -b com.jabra.chromehost
    3. run builddiskimage.sh
    4. run notarize.sh -u <username> -p <password> -f JabraChromeHostxxxx.dmg -b com.jabra.chromehost

### Uninstalling chromehost installers

For windows, chromehost can be uninstalled using add/remove programs. 

For MacOS, the [uninstall.sh](../src/InstallermacOS/uninstall.sh) can be used from a shell (sudo required).

## Internal message format between API, Extension and Chromehost

All communication between API, Extension and chromehost is based on message 
passing of basically the same json structure as documented in typescript format below:

General message format:
```typescript
{
           // Used for API and extension communication - not used by chromehost:
           direction?: string,
           // Used for all commands, responses, events. Null or "na" for errors.
           message?: string,
           // Used for errors only.
           error?: string,
           // Command arguments
           args?: any,
           // Response data, not used for requests.
           data?: any, 
           // Unique arbitary ID for each request used to pair requests with results. Empty for device orginating events!
           requestId?: number | string,
           // Unique arbitary ID for each api client instance used to pair requests with requesters. Empty for device orginating events!
           apiClientId?: string,
           // JS client api version.
           version_jsapi?: string,
           // Reserved for non-Jabra clients. Not presently used.
           customClientName?: string
           // Reserved for non-Jabra clients. Not presently used.
           customClientVersion?: string
}
```

The same generic format is used (with variation) for both requests, responses and device events in different layers of the stack.

The actual values used to fillout "requestId" and "apiClientId" in requests are not important but they should be unique across different requests and clients retrospectively. Clients use the values for pairing request messages with response messages. Clients should set these values to some unique values in requests and clients should ignore responses with non-empty(!) values that are different from what is expected.

### Development notes
The best way to learn the exact messages send/returned is to [enable all logging](../Readme.md#Logging) at 'trace' level and observe communication while using the test tool to issue commands and/or perform device actions.

When interfacing with the Chromehost executable, note that the number of messages and their exact content are likely to change over time. Because of backwards compatability changes to existing messages are most likely to be simple expansions like new fields etc. Integrating code should thus be written in a way so it ignores extra information like unknown fields.

### Chromehost command examples:

The examples shows common request/responses when sending commands. Note that not all commands have arguments, results or event responses.

#### getinstallinfo with result

Request:
```json 
{ 
    "message": "getinstallinfo", 
    "args": {}, 
    "requestId": 3, 
    "apiClientId": "3krfvjxzl"
}
```

Response:
```json 
{ 
    "message": "Event: getinstallinfo", 
    "requestId": 3, 
    "apiClientId": "3krfvjxzl", 
    "data": {
        "chromehost_logpath": "<somepath>\\JabraChromehost.log",
        "version_chromehost": "2.0.0",
        "version_nativesdk": "1.4.0.10"
    }
}
```

#### setmmifocus with response confirmation but no result

Request:
```json 
{ 
    "message": "setmmifocus", 
    "args": { 
        "capture":true, 
        "type":18
    }, 
    "requestId": 6,
    "apiClientId": "2qub8atrm"
}
```

Response:
```json 
{ 
    "message": "Event: setmmifocus", 
    "requestId": 6, 
    "apiClientId": "2qub8atrm", 
    "data": null
}
```

#### offhook without response

Request:
```json 
{ 
    "message": "offhook", 
    "args": {}, 
    "requestId": 7, 
    "apiClientId": "2qub8atrm"
}
```

#### error response
```json 
{
    "apiClientId": "2qub8atrm",
    "data": null,
    "error": "Error: No device",
    "message": "na",
    "requestId": 7
}
```

### Chromehost event examples:

The example(s) below show examples of device events that are orginating from a device or from
physically adding/removing a device (i.e. without a command being issued). Note that apiClientId and requestId are empty for such events.

#### device attach event 

```json 
{
    "data": {
        "batteryCharging":false,
        "batteryLevelInPercent":100,
        "batteryLow":false,
        "deviceConnection":"USB",
        "deviceFeatures":[1003],
        "deviceID":0,
        "deviceName":"Jabra SPEAK 510 USB",
        "errStatus":0,
        "firmwareVersion":"2.25.0",
        "isInFirmwareUpdateMode":false,
        "productID":1058,
        "serialNumber":"xxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "skypeCertified":true,
        "variant":"08-01"
    },
    "message": "Event: device attached",
    "apiClientId":"",
    "requestId":""
}
```
